# AI-Powered UFDR Forensic Assistant Prototype

Hackathon-ready demo that ingests Universal Forensic Data Reports (UFDRs), builds structured evidence stores, and answers investigator questions in natural language using a hybrid SQL¬†+ semantic search + knowledge graph pipeline.

Refer to the parent document [AI-Powered Forensic UFDR Assistant ‚Äì Complete SIH Solution](../AI-Powered%20Forensic%20UFDR%20Assistant%20-%20Complete%20SIH.md) for extended architectural background.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

- **UFDR parsing** for contacts, chats, calls, locations, and media across XML/CSV/HTML exports.
- **Relational storage** (SQLite via SQLAlchemy) with normalized tables and provenance metadata.
- **Vector search** with TF-IDF embeddings for semantic message retrieval.
- **Knowledge graph** (NetworkX) capturing people ‚Üî messages ‚Üî keywords ‚Üî calls ‚Üî locations.
- **Rule-based NL query engine** that routes requests across SQL, vector index, and graph insights.
- **FastAPI service** exposing `/ingest` and `/query` endpoints for rapid demo and integration.

## üöÄ Quickstart

> Prerequisites: Python¬†3.11 (or compatible) + virtual environment (already configured in this workspace).

Install dependencies:

```powershell
C:/Users/astra/Desktop/Dectective-X/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r prototype/requirements.txt
```

Navigate into the prototype workspace:

```powershell
cd prototype
```

Ingest the bundled sample UFDR (creates SQLite DB, vector index, and knowledge graph):

```powershell
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m src.ingestion.pipeline
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```powershell
../.venv/Scripts/uvicorn.exe src.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Query the assistant (after ingestion) from a new terminal:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
	  -d '{"query": "show foreign crypto messages after 10 pm"}'
```

Run the test suite:

```powershell
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## üîÑ Data Flow & AI Orchestration

1. **Ingestion (`src/ingestion/pipeline.py`)**
	- Parses CSV/XML/HTML artifacts.
	- Normalizes content into SQLite tables (`contacts`, `messages`, `calls`, `locations`, `keywords`, `media`).
	- Builds TF-IDF vector index for semantic message search.
	- Creates a node-link knowledge graph (JSON) linking people, communications, and entities.
2. **Query Engine (`src/ai/query_engine.py`)**
	- Classifies user intent (messages, calls, connection analysis) via keyword heuristics.
	- Executes hybrid retrieval: SQL filters, vector similarity, and graph insights.
	- Returns structured evidence snippets plus a human-readable summary.
3. **API Layer (`src/app.py`)**
	- `/ingest`: (re)builds all stores from a UFDR bundle.
	- `/query`: answers natural language prompts with evidence payloads and highlights.

## üß™ Demo Scenario

Try the following once the API is running:

- `"List messages mentioning crypto from foreign numbers after 10 PM"`
- `"Show connections between John Doe and Bitcoin Broker"`
- `"Calls with non-Indian contacts"`

Each response includes relevant chat transcripts, associated calls, and graph-based relationship hints.

## üîê Forensic Integrity Hooks

- Deterministic UFDR path references (`raw_path`, `media_path`) for evidence provenance.
- SHA-256 hashing ready in `storage/database.Media` (populate via future file hashing step).
- `reset_storage()` utility clears state safely for repeatable demo runs.

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps & Enhancements

- Swap TF-IDF embeddings with domain-tuned language models (e.g., `sentence-transformers`).
- Integrate LLM frameworks (LangChain/LlamaIndex) for richer intent detection and explanations.
- Extend graph analytics (community detection, shortest path, anomaly scoring).
- Add RBAC, audit trails, and tamper-proof hashing for production forensic workflows.
- Build a polished investigator UI (Streamlit/React) with timeline, filter chips, and graph visualization.
